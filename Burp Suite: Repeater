Burp Suite: Repeater
   
Learn how to use Repeater to duplicate requests in Burp Suite

Task 1  Introduction Outline
Deploy the machine (and the AttackBox if you are not using your own attack VM), and let's get started!
Note: If you are not using the AttackBox and want to connect to this machine without the VPN, you can do so using this link once the machine has fully loaded and an IP address is displayed: https://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com.

Task 2  Repeater What is Repeater?
Familiarise yourself with the Repeater interface.
= No answer needed

Task 3  Repeater Basic Usage
Capture a request to http://MACHINE_IP in the Proxy and send it to Repeater.
Practice modifying and re-sending the request numerous times.

= No answer needed

Task 4  Repeater Views
Experiment with the available view options.

= No answer needed
Which view option displays the response in the same format as your browser would?

= Render

Task 5  Repeater Inspector
Get comfortable with Inspector and practice adding/removing items from the various request sections.

Task 6  Practical Example
Capture a request to http://MACHINE_IP/ in the Proxy and send it to Repeater.

= No answer needed
Send the request once from Repeater -- you should see the HTML source code for the page you requested in the response tab.

Try viewing this in one of the other view options (e.g. Rendered).

= No answer needed

Using Inspector (or manually, if you prefer), add a header called FlagAuthorised and set it to have a value of True. e.g.:

Headers with FlagAuthorised Added
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: MACHINE_IP
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
FlagAuthorised: True
Send the request. What is the flag you receive?

= THM{Yzg2MWI2ZDhlYzdlNGFiZTUzZTIzMzVi}

Task 7  Practical Challenge
Capture a request to one of the numeric products endpoints in the Proxy, then forward it to Repeater.

= No answer needed

See if you can get the server to error out with a "500 Internal Server Error" code by changing the number at the end of the request to extreme inputs.

What is the flag you receive when you cause a 500 error in the endpoint?

= THM{N2MzMzFhMTA1MmZiYjA2YWQ4M2ZmMzhl}

Task 8  Extra Mile SQLi with Repeater
We know that there is a vulnerability, and we know where it is. Now we just need to exploit it!
Let's start by capturing a request to http://MACHINE_IP/about/2 in the Burp Proxy. Once you have captured the request, send it to Repeater with Ctrl + R or by right-clicking and choosing "Send to Repeater".

= No answer needed
Now that we have our request primed, let's confirm that a vulnerability exists. Adding a single apostrophe (') is usually enough to cause the server to error when a simple SQLi is present, so, either using Inspector or by editing the request path manually, add an apostrophe after the "2" at the end of the path and send the request:
Response Headers from the Server
GET /about/2' HTTP/1.1
Host: MACHINE_IP
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

You should see that the server responds with a "500 Internal Server Error", indicating that we successfully broke the query:

Response Headers from the Server
HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR<
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 2021 23:05:21 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 3101

= No answer needed

With this information, we can skip over the query column number and table name enumeration steps.

= No answer needed

Exploit the union SQL injection vulnerability in the site.

What is the flag?

= THM{ZGE3OTUyZGMyMzkwNjJmZjg3Mzk1NjJh}
